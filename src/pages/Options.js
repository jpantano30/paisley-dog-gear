        Explore our range of customizable gear options for your pets. All leashes are made with 5/8" Beta BiothaneÂ® â€” a waterproof, odor-resistant material known for its durability, flexibility, and comfort in hand. This size offers a pull strength of around 600â€“750 lbs, depending on hardware and configuration. Each piece is assembled using high-quality Chicago screws with threadlock for added security.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you need something heavier-duty, 3/4" and 1" Biothane is available for leashes by request â€” ideal for larger dogs or handlers looking for a wider grip and added strength. Collars can be made in widths up to 1.5" on request, which is perfect for large dogs or bold statement styles. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong> Custom designs are encouraged!</strong>
